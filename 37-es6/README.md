Used heavily in Mod 4 for React:
- destructuring
- spreading
- `slice()` or `Object.assign()`
- all the forms of arrow functions
- function binding vs arrow functions
- class instance properties
- passing functions around as arguments
- dynamic object keys
  - This is only for one trick we use in React forms.

Towards the end and for Mod 5:
- higher order functions

- `slice()` or `Object.assign()`
- all forms of ()=>{}
- class instance properties
- import and export  / require
- `super()`
- dynamic object keys
- higher order functions
- WYSMNBWYG- what you see may not be what you get; specifically `this` weirdness in babel
- destructuring
