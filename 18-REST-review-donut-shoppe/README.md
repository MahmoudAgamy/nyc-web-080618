# Rails Review Donut Shoppe

- Create our donuts: `rails g resource Donut name sprinkles:boolean filling tasty:boolean`

  - `resource` gives us: a migration, a model, a controller, RESTful routes, and an empty views folder

- Forms
- REST: What should our routes be? How should I be thinking about my routes.
